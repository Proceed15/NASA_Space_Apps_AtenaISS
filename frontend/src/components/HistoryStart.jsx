      <p>
        In 1998, the first module, Zarya, was launched. From there began humanity's greatest engineering feat in orbit.
        In 1999, the first crew, Expedition 1, arrived at the station, marking the beginning of a continuous human presence in space ever since.
        In 2000, Expedition 1, composed of Russian cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev, and American astronaut William Shepherd, arrived at the station.
